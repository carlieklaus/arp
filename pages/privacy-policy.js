                        The Fair Information Practices Principles form the
                        backbone of privacy law in the United States and the
                        concepts they include have played a significant role in
                        the development of data protection laws around the
                        globe. Understanding the Fair Information Practice
                        Principles and how they should be implemented is
                        critical to comply with the various privacy laws that
                        protect personal information.

                        We also agree to the Individual Redress Principle which
                        requires that individuals have the right to legally
                        pursue enforceable rights against data collectors and
                        processors who fail to adhere to the law. This principle
                        requires not only that individuals have enforceable
                        rights against data users, but also that individuals
                        have recourse to courts or government agencies to
                        investigate and/or prosecute non-compliance by data
