                      Authors will need to discuss their specific requirements
                      for a publicity campaign with our senior author advisors.

                      One of our writers will create the feature article, which
                      will then be sent to the author for approval.
                      Alternatively, the author may opt for an interview for
                      placement on the publications concerned.

                    <li>
                      Our publicists will then pitch the article to all
                      publications, blog sites, magazines, and journals that may
                      potentially find it interesting for their readers.

                      Besides the traditional media publications, we will

                      option to have it shared via their social media pages as

                      Authors will receive a copy of the pertinent article both
                      in digital and web formats. In addition, a summary report
                      about all the media outlets that received our query letter
                      for article placement will be sent via email to the
