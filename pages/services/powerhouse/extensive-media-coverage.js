                  Our in-house team of publicists will pitch your book to these
                  publications and TV network to secure a coverage for you and
                  your book. This may come in the form of a TV interview or a

                  <h5>Why It Matters</h5>
                  <p>
                    Media coverage can help bolster your name in the literary
                    world due to the third-party validation-effect bestowed by
                    the media organization’s blue stamp. Obtaining publicity can
                    offer far greater value to authors seeking to grow their
                    readership than other marketing methods.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Favorable media coverage is a powerful tool to establish
                    your credibility as an author. More importantly, it is a
                    golden opportunity to get your message across to a broader
                    audience.
