                        Print ads allow you to target your audience. You’ re in
                        full control of exactly what section of the newspaper or
                        magazine you place your ad in, and you can do this based
                        on information about where your audience is most likely
                        to read. You can run your ad in a special section of a
                        publication or anywhere in the paper.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        You can also tailor your campaigns to suit your budget.
                        Even more, you will be working with a human being when
                        you buy your ad space, so you won’ t be at the mercy of
                        an online algorithm that decides where your ads are
                        seen. Print media provides you much more customization
                        than digital ads.
