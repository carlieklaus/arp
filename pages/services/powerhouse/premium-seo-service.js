                  Search Engine Optimization (SEO) – Creating a website to sell
                  your book marks a stepping stone for your online promotional
                  strategies as an author. However, it’s only the beginning of a
                  larger effort to bolster your presence on the web, which
                  involves an effective SEO service.
                </p>

                <p style={{ marginTop: "1rem" }}>
                  You’ll later encounter a few challenges such as driving
                  traffic to your website and coming up in the first page of
                  search results. Furthermore, you need to maintain your search
                  engine rank and stay ahead of the competition. This is where
                  SEO Service comes in. In a nutshell, search engine
                  optimization is the method of edging out your competing
                  websites in search results.
                </p>

                <p style={{ marginTop: "1rem" }}>
                  As an example, when you search for “action adventure books”,
                  the first page of the results shows popular titles from major
                  traditional publishers or Amazon listings. While those books
                  fall under the same genre as yours, they’ve made it to the top
                  pages of Google Search or Bing, for example. This means those
                  titles are easier to find for people searching for that
                  specific book genre while books that appear in the third and
                  fourth pages have a slimmer chance of getting noticed.
                </p>

                <p style={{ marginTop: "1rem" }}>
                  The difference? Those book titles have an effective SEO
                  campaign. It involves a series of steps that makes your
                  website appealing to Google, which in turn will give it a
                  higher ranking. After all, what’s the point of creating a
                  website if nobody can easily find it? With proper planning and
                  research, SEO will help send more visitors to your website.

                      <p>
                        Just like market study, keyword research is an essential
                        first step in SEO. We’ll find a set of keyword strings
                        with a high search volume on search engines like Google
                        or Bing using a premium SEO tool. These keyword sets are
                        based on your book’s title, genre, or theme. We’ll then
                        use these keywords to optimize your website and make it
                        more discoverable on search engines. In addition, we’ll
                        choose longer keyword strings. The longer these key
                        phrases are, the more likely people who search for them
                        will buy your book.
                      </p>
                      <h6>Backlinks</h6>
                      <p>
                        We’ll create links to your content on forums where your
                        book or theme may be relevant to generate organic
                        backlinks. We’ll also post comments on blog articles
                        with links to your web pages in order to provide more
                        SEO juices for your site. Finally, we’ll reach out to
                        several blog sites and ask them to link to your content.
                      </p>
                      <h6>Content Optimization</h6>
                      <p>
                        Keywords help match your site’s content to what most
                        people are searching for on Google. Therefore, we’ll
                        fine-tune these keywords to align your content with the
                        right type of traffic you’re looking for.
