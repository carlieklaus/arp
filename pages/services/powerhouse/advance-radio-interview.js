                    <p style={{ marginTop: "1rem" }}>
                      Prior to the actual interview, Delaney will coach you with
                      the right materials and techniques to quickly capture the
                      attention of listeners. Delaney will provide instructions
                      on the proper ways of presenting your ideas and you can’t
                      miss hitting the right audience for your book.

                      stations with more than three million listeners. The
                      teaser will run for two weeks with an accompanying set of

                      chance to promote your book on a deeper, personal level,
                      talking directly to your potential readers using the
                      techniques Delaney has taught you. A recorded interview is
