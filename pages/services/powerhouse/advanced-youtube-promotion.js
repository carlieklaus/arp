                <p style={{ marginTop: "1rem" }}>
                  Independently published books need more than just traditional
                  media channels for promotion. With the onslaught of online
                  platforms, content now holds sway over the success of your
                  book. Therefore, It makes perfect sense more than ever to
                  consider mainstream web services when looking for marketing
                  channels, such as YouTube promotion.

                  Video sharing websites like YouTube play a key role in online
                  marketing. With 2 billion users worldwide, YouTube is the best
                  platform to give your book a wide exposure across a vast range
                  of audiences.

                  YouTube’s user engagement far more outruns any other social
                  platforms as people actively search for content, unlike other
                  social media where users merely scrolling down the feed of
                  information. With YouTube, authors are more likely to capture
                  the reader’s attention than they would in other platforms.
