                    The New York Times Sunday Book Review directs your ad to
                    your target audience – the book readers. The magazine has a
                    more specific focus than any marketing platform. People who
                    subscribed to a magazine made a deliberate choice to read
                    it, thus they sift through every page. In contrast, people
                    searching online spend only seconds to scan a website.

                  <p>
                    The New York Times Sunday Book Review is one of the most
                    coveted pages for book reviews, and landing a spot on the
                    publication is a unique opportunity to be discovered as an
                    author. The magazine commands a huge following that
                    comprises 831,000 print readers in the U.S. It has a
                    reputation of recommending only the most riveting books that
                    deserve critical acclaim. When readers see your book
                    featured in an ad on the NYT Sunday Book Review, they view
                    it with more respect than if they saw it in a lesser known
                    publication.

                    our authors deserve nothing less than an extensive marketing
                    campaign to cement their way to fame.
