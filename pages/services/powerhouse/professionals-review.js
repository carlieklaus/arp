                  Professional reviews lend more credibility to your book and
                  influence the buying decision of readers who depend on them to
                  pick what books are worth their money and time. When they see
                  numerous reviews for a book, they tend to invest more in it.
                  If the reviews are particularly convincing, readers browsing
                  through Amazon or Barnes & Noble might buy the book simply
                  from reading these recommendations.
                </p>

                <p style={{ marginTop: "1rem" }}>
                  On top of credibility, reviews can make your books more
                  discoverable in online searches, thus improving the way Amazon
                  recommends your book. Many authors are unaware that reviews
                  play a key function in Amazon’s algorithm: the more reviews
                  your book has, the more likely Amazon will recommend it. The
                  more positive online reviews your book receives, the higher it
                  will be ranked on the charts and the more readers will see it.
                  This can give a huge boost to your book sales.

                <p style={{ marginTop: "1rem" }}>
                  Aside from readers, booksellers and librarians rely on reviews
                  to decide what books to stock. They often prefer reviews from
                  mainstream media, publications, and the Professionals
                  themselves. A review that gives a positive feedback for your
                  book and credited to a well-known source will catch a
                  bookseller’s attention.

                <p style={{ marginTop: "1rem" }}>
                  Positive reviews, in particular, can reassure anyone who
                  stumbles upon your book on Amazon or a physical bookstore that
                  what they are about to purchase is worth their investment.
