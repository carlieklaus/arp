                        Print advertising has a higher frequency opportunity of
                        viewing than online ads. Since the newspaper or magazine
                        may sit on a table or rack at a business or home,
                        repeated exposures are allowed. Flyers, brochures, and
                        other physical pieces are often reviewed multiple times
                        and shared with other prospects. Unlike digital
                        messaging, print media do not disappear after generating
                        an impression. It piles up, creates clutter, and is
                        thereby reviewed once more, even before recycling or
                        discarding. Because of this long shelf life, you can
                        benefit from having your ad seen by more people more
                        often.
