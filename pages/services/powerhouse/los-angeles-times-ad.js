                        Print advertising has a higher frequency opportunity of
                        viewing than online ads. Since the newspaper or magazine
                        may sit on a table or rack at a business or home,
                        repeated exposures are allowed. Flyers, brochures, and
                        other physical pieces are often reviewed multiple, times
                        and shared with other prospects. Unlike digital
                        messaging, print media does not disappear after
                        generating an impression. It piles up, creates clutter,
                        and is thereby reviewed once more, even before recycling
                        or discarding. Because of this long shelf life, you can
                        benefits from having your ad seen by more people more
                        often.
