    desc: "The year is 2048. In lands beyond a wall-enclosed city known as the Tiered Nations, a war is waging between dragons and Wyrms. Ardyce, a Tree Crown Drake and leader of her people, ventures out to investigate a gaping hole in the land. She is joined by her kin and friend, Sasithorn, who soon must fight for their lives when a Wyrm suddenly attacks. Within the Tiered Nations, a mantra exists: “Live beyond satiation,” and consumerism is the only religion. Hadryn and his best friend Thaddius are soldiers, investigating an unusual death at the city’s morgue: a limb-hewn corpse, which appears to have been mauled when animals are no longer of this world. Meat products, as well as all foods, are grown in laboratories and manufactured as “cubed food.” Before Hadryn and Thaddius can further their examination of the body, two letters arrive for Hadryn. One is from a woman, Oshin Rysing, who is Hadryn’s long-time epistolary paramour, living outside the Tiered Nations in a rebel colony which resists the gluttonous ways of the city. The second letter is from his father to notify Hadryn that he will be wedded to an unknown man, as is customary for young women of marital age. Hadryn attends his engagement banquet with the intention of confronting his father, but strange occurrences of people, who seem to be infected with a terrible disease leading to self-cannibalism arise, and a creature out of nightmares emerges",

    price: 7.99,
    desc: "Each dreamlike lyric in Biman Roy’s Navigating the Quartz Forest is charmingly paired with a small handwritten note hastily jotted down on blue-lined notebook paper-artifacts from his daughter’s life outside the family home. “All through the evening, we keep talking nonessentials, / tiptoeing around secret tulips,” he says. These notes, like scraps of overheard conversations removed from their natural habitats, become the crystalline seeds of new poems. Side-by-side with each other, the poems act as translator for these somewhat oracular messages from an unknown world of teenage gossip and pop culture references, fitting the pieces together like a shattered mirror and filling in the jagged-edged gaps with the poet’s expansive imagination. In Navigating the Quartz Forest, Roy’s whimsical poems become a sparkling tribute from a father to his beloved daughter.",

These people have helped influenced the growth of our generation and generations to follow. Lift Ev’ry Voice and Sing does not attempt to present every African American who has made important contributions to our society, for that would almost be endless, but it is only a small collection of those who have. Although Lift Ev’ry Voice and Sing is about African Americans, it was written for everyone to read and enjoy.",
